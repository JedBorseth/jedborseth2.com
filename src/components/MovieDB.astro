    The Movie Database Project is a collaborative web application designed to offer users a seamless experience in browsing, searching, and discovering movies. The project was built using the Next.js Pages Router, a powerful React-based framework that allowed us to create a highly optimized and fast-loading interface for movie lovers. By leveraging the capabilities of Supabase as the backend, we were able to manage a robust and scalable database for storing movie information, user reviews, and more.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
    Developing the Movie Database Project presented several interesting challenges:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li><strong>Data Management with Supabase:</strong> Managing and structuring a database for thousands of movies required careful planning. We utilized Supabase's scalability and real-time features to keep data consistent and accessible. By designing efficient SQL queries and indexes, we optimized data retrieval times.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication Integration:</strong> Integrating Next Auth with various providers was complex. We addressed this by utilizing OAuth flows and customizing authentication logic to fit our needs, ensuring user data remained secure while providing a smooth login experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration Between Team Members:</strong> Coordinating efforts across four team members required strong communication. To streamline our workflow, we utilized tools like Git for version control and Trello for task management, ensuring everyone was on the same page.</li>
    <li><strong>UI/UX Consistency:</strong> Ensuring a consistent look and feel across different parts of the application was challenging due to the involvement of multiple developers. Using Scss with a shared design system helped us maintain uniformity in components and styling.</li>
  </ul>
